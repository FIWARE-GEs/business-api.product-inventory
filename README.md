## API Overview

The Product Inventory API provides a standardized mechanism for product inventory management such as creation,
partial or full update and retrieval of the representation of a product in the inventory. It also allows the
notification of events related to product lifecycle.

For example, product inventory API can be used to retrieve products owned by a customer or update the status
of an installed product.
